[Codeweek](http://codeweek.eu/) is fast approaching, and when we took a look at the fun things we might do in Austria... there were no events! So we thought, hey, wouldn't this be a fantastic opportunity to hold our first [vienna.caa](viennacss.github.io) event?

>This event focuses on teaching CSS3 transitions and animations to everyone, regardless of skill-level or programming experience! Feel free to join us - even if this is your first time programming!
Inspired by Eva Lettner's #30daysofhoverstates challenge , we aim to introduce the magic of CSS3's awesome toolkit, and get everyone excited about the beautiful things they can build on the web.
We will have a workshop, first showing the powerful things that can be achieved with simple CSS, and later help you hone your own CSS superpowers!
This event will be held in English, and is open to all participants of all skill levels. The space is accessibility friendly. We have a code of conduct that we expect all attendees to commit to: http://berlincodeofconduct.org/ For further information, feel free to contact us!
